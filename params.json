[John Tukey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tukey), an American mathematician has contributed significantly to the development of EDA and was instrumental in distinguishing EDA from Confirmatory data analysis and Initial data analysis. He published a book, [Exploratory Data Analysis](http://www.amazon.com/Exploratory-Data-Analysis-John-Tukey/dp/0201076160) in 1977 and introduced [box plot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot).\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this post, we will cover the fundamentals of EDA using [R](http://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/). The R codes used in this tutorial can be found at [Github](https://github.com/jovialman/Exploratory-Data-Analysis). An accomapnying video has been uploaded on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtYOUXeNhu0). The slides used in the video are available at [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/).\r\n\r\n\r\n* [Overview & Objectives](Overview & Objectives)\r\n* [Types of EDA](Types of EDA)\r\n* [Univariate](Univariate)\r\n    * [Quantitative](Univariate Quantitative)\r\n    * [Graphical](Univariate Graphical)\r\n* [Bivariate](Bivariate)\r\n    * [Quantitative](Bivariate Quantitative)\r\n    * [Graphical](Bivariate Graphical)\r\n* [Case Study](Case Study)\r\n* [Resources](Resources)\r\n\r\n##### Overview & Objectives\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, any method of analysing data that is not part of formal statistical modeling and inference falls into the category of exploratory data analysis. Before we build statistical models or do any other analysis, it is important to examine all the variables in our data set.\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\n* Discover any existing patterns \r\n* Identify mistakes\r\n* Suggest hypothesis that can be tested\r\n* Check assumptions\r\n* Identify relationships among explanatory variables\r\n* Assess direction and size of relationship between expplanatory and outcome                      variables\r\n\r\nIt is not possible for us to determine the characterisits of data by looking at columns or a whole spreadsheet and this is when EDA comes to our aid. It is also important to keep in mind the problems with EDA:\r\n\r\n* Does not have the same rigor of formal statistical techniques\r\n* It cannot be used for prediction or inference\r\n* Not efficient in case of voluminous data \r\n\r\nIn the next section, we look at the objectives of EDA.\r\n\r\n\r\n##### Types of EDA\r\n\r\nEDA can be broadly classified into the following:\r\n\r\n* Graphical or Quantitative \r\n* Univariate or Bivariate\r\n\r\nQuantitative methods include summary statisitcs while graphical methods include plots and charts. Univariate methods involve analysing one variable at a time while bivariate involves analysing two or more variables to examine their underlying relationships. EDA also depends on the role of variable being examined:\r\n\r\n* Outcome variable\r\n* Explanatory variable\r\n\r\nFurther division is based on the type of variable being examined:\r\n\r\n* Categorical variable\r\n    * Binary\r\n    * Ordinal\r\n    * Nominal\r\n    \r\n* Quantitative variable\r\n    * Discrete\r\n    * Continuous\r\n\r\n##### Univariate\r\n\r\n###### Univariate Quantitative\r\n\r\nUnivariate analysis includes:\r\n\r\n###### Measures of central tendancy:\r\n\r\n* Mean\r\n* Median\r\n* Mode\r\n\r\n###### Measures of dispersion:\r\n\r\n* Min\r\n* Max\r\n* Range\r\n* Quartiles\r\n* Variance\r\n* Standard deviation\r\n\r\n###### Other measures include:\r\n\r\n* Skewness\r\n* Kurtosis\r\n\r\nWe will explore each of the above in detail in the [case study](Case Study) provided at the end of this tutorial.\r\n\r\n###### Univariate Graphical\r\n\r\nGraphical methods include the following:\r\n\r\n* Histogram\r\n* Box plots\r\n* Bar plots\r\n* Kernel density plots\r\n\r\n\r\n##### Bivariate\r\n\r\n###### Bivariate Quantitative\r\n\r\nBivariate analysis include:\r\n\r\n* Crosstabs\r\n* Covariance \r\n* Correlation\r\n\r\nAdvanced techniques include:\r\n\r\n* Cluster analysis\r\n* Analysis of variance (ANOVA)\r\n* Factor analysis\r\n* Principal component analysis (PCA)\r\n\r\n\r\n###### Bivariate Graphical\r\n\r\nGraphical techniques include:\r\n\r\n* Scatterplot\r\n* Box plot\r\n\r\n#### Case Study\r\n\r\nIn this case study, we will select a data set that has all the variable types discussed in [Types of EDA](Types of EDA). R has a lot of built-in data sets which come as part of the packages and can be used. We will use a data set from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.html). You can download the data set from [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing). It is related to direct marketing campaigns of a Portugese Bank. The description of the data set can be found at the website. Please go through the tutorials on using [RStudio](add a link) and [Github](add a link) to better organise your analysis and pojects.\r\n\r\nNow, without further delay, let us begin our analysis.\r\n\r\n* Step 1 : Create a new project in RStudio and name it *Exploratory Data Analysis*.\r\n* Step 2 : Create a new R file and save it as *Codes*.\r\n* Step 3 : Download the bank direct marketing data set from [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing).\r\n\r\nWe have the data set in our project folder. Let us *EDA*:\r\n\r\n```{r}\r\n# check working directory\r\ngetwd()\r\n\r\n# import the data set into the current workspace\r\ndata <- read.csv(\"bank-data.csv\", header = T)\r\n\r\n# let us explore the data set a bit\r\nView(data)  # allows us to view the data set\r\nnames(data)  # names of the variables \r\ndim(data)  # dimension (number of rows and columns)\r\nstr(data)  # structure of the data set\r\nclass(data)  # type of data\r\nhead(data, n = 5)  # displays the first 5 rows \r\ntail(data, n = 5)  # displays the last 5 rows\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen we run str(data), R displays comprehensive information about the data set. It provides the following details:\r\n\r\n* Type of data set: dataframe, vector, matrix, list\r\n* Dimensions of the data set: Number of rows and columns\r\n* Variable name\r\n* Variable type: Factor, integer, numeric\r\n\r\nWe will select one variable from the data set for the following category of variables:\r\n\r\n* **Continuos**: age\r\n* **Binary**: housing\r\n* **Nominal**: marital\r\n* **Ordinal**: education\r\n\r\nR has a wide range of built-in functions for summary statistics. Before we explore these functions, let us install the necessary [packages](add a link) and load the libraries. Packages can be installed using install.packages() and loaded using library(). Install and load the following packages:\r\n\r\n* install.packages(\"Hmisc\")\r\n* install.packages(\"pastecs\")\r\n* install.packages(\"psych\")\r\n\r\n```{r packages}\r\nlibrary(Hmisc)\r\nlibrary(pastecs)\r\nlibrary(psych)\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet us run some codes and examine the output:\r\n\r\n```{r }\r\nsummary(data)\r\n```\r\n\r\nExamining the output of the summary function, we can see that the result is different for continuos and categorical variables. For categorical variables, only the count of different levels is provided while for the continuos variables there are a bunch of statistics. Let us subset the data set by selecting the 4 variables mentioned earlier.\r\n\r\n```{r subset}\r\nvar <- c(\"age\", \"marital\", \"education\", \"housing\")\r\neda_data <- data[var]\r\nnames(eda_data)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe have a new data set \"eda_data\" which we will use for the rest of the analysis. Let us do some univariate analysis on the \"age\" variable. We begin with quantitative techniques before exploring the graphical techniques.\r\n\r\n```{r}\r\nsummary(eda_data$age)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe mean and median are pretty close and we can say that the distribution of the variable is approximately normal (we will test this with a graphical technique at a later stage). We will use the **fivenum()** function next. The fivenum() function displays the min, max, median, lower-hinge and upper-hinge values.\r\n\r\n```{r }\r\nfivenum(eda_data$age)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```{r }\r\ndescribe(eda_data$age)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe **describe()** function which is part of the **Hmisc** package displays the following additional statistics:\r\n\r\n* Number of rows\r\n* Standard deviation\r\n* Trimmed mean\r\n* Mean absolute deviation\r\n* Skewness \r\n* Kurtosis\r\n* Standard error\r\n\r\n```{r }\r\nstat.desc(eda_data$age)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe **stat.desc()** function which is part of the **pastecs** package displays the following additional statistics:\r\n\r\n* Variance\r\n* Coefficient of variation\r\n* Confidence interval for mean\r\n\r\nWe now move on to the graphical techniques that can be employed for EDA and begin with the **histogram**. The **age** variables is positively **skewed** as we can see marginal frequency for age greater than 60.\r\n\r\n#### Histogram\r\n\r\n```{r histogram}\r\nhist(eda_data$age,\r\n     main = \"Histogram of Age\",\r\n     xlab = \"Age in Years\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Boxplot\r\n\r\n```{r boxplot}\r\nboxplot(eda_data$age,\r\n        main = toupper(\"Boxplot of Age\"),\r\n        ylab = \"Age in years\",\r\n        col = \"blue\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Kernel Density plot\r\n\r\n```{r kernel density plot}\r\nd <- density(eda_data$age)\r\nplot(d, main = \"Kernel density of Age\")\r\npolygon(d, col = \"red\", border = \"blue\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
